The Beat of the Vajra Drum
by Shechen Rabjam Rinpoche

kalden dak gi gön chok kadrinchen
How fortunate I am to have such a sublime protector as you,
dü sum gyalwa malü kündüpé
Padmasambhava of Oḍḍiyāna,
orgyen pema jungné khyé nyen na
Embodiment of all the Buddhas throughout the three times.
bu chik ma shyin tukjé tak kyong té
Always care for me in your compassion as a mother would her only child!

chi nang sangwé barché kün sel shying
Remove all outer, inner and secret obstacles,
döpé dön nam malü lhün gyi drub
Spontaneously fulfil my each and every wish,
ten dror menpé samjor tarchin né
Bless me to perfect my thoughts and deeds to aid the teachings and beings,
gön khyö gongpa kong nü jingyi lob
And grant me the capacity to fulfil your enlightened vision!

rangrig dön gyi guru dewa ché
Self-awareness is itself the Guru of Great Bliss,
nying ü dab gyé pema lhenkyé su
Who sits ever-present upon the eight-petalled lotus at the centre of my heart –
döné yeshe dorjé nyingpö sok
The primordial Vajra Wisdom, the essence of my being,
takten pogyur dral di emaho
Permanent, stable and unfluctuating – how wonderful!

Gyurme Chöseng, who merely holds the title of Seventh Rabjam, composed this based on an earlier
request from Shechen Khentrul Gutsé, when arriving in Dewekota in the hidden realm of
Pemakö, sacred to Guru Padmasambhava.
